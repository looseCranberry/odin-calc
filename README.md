Calculator project for The Odin Project
Last project for Foundations

This calculator will handle all basic calculator functions as well
as more complicated formulas, following PEMDAS because that's what I learned in school.
Not this PEDMAS nonsense.

The calculator will also handle keyboard shortcuts and write-in formulas that will be
parsed rather than interpreted or evaluated

Should be fun!
